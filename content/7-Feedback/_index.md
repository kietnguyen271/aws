### General Feedback

**1. Working environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is friendly and easy to adapt to. Everyone in the company is very supportive and willing to help whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace and office areas are organized neatly and equipped with essential facilities such as power outlets, air conditioning, and projectors.

**2. Support from mentor / admin team**  
My mentor provides clear guidance, explains technical issues in detail, and encourages me to explore solutions on my own before giving direct answers. This helps me improve my self-learning ability. The admin team responds quickly with paperwork and resources, and always creates favorable conditions for interns.

**3. Alignment between tasks and my major**  
The tasks assigned match well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also allowing me to develop new skills such as cloud computing, serverless technology, and system architecture. This helps me strengthen my foundation while gaining valuable hands-on experience.

**4. Opportunities for learning and development**  
Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to develop many important skills: working with AWS services, collaborating in a team, discussing technical topics, presenting progress, and participating in insightful events. My mentor also shared practical experiences that helped me better orient my future career path.

**5. Team culture and collaboration**  
During my internship, what impressed me most was the supportive culture at FCJ. Everyone is willing to share knowledge, give constructive feedback, and work together when facing difficult tasks. There is no gap between interns and full-time staff; everyone is listened to and treated with respect. When the project becomes urgent, the whole team cooperates smoothly, shares workload, and motivates each other to achieve the common goal. This made me feel very comfortable working here and truly consider myself part of the team.

**6. Policies for interns**  
The company offers flexible working hours, making it easier to balance studying and working. In addition, during events, there are always small gifts for participating students, creating a friendly atmosphere where we can learn while also enjoying the experience.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- The aspect I appreciate the most is the flexible working policy, which allows interns to choose their on-site working days. This creates a comfortable environment and helps me maintain a good balance between my studies and internship responsibilities.

- This is an excellent environment for IT students. Therefore, I would gladly recommend AWS/FCJ to my friends so they can also gain practical experience and learn valuable knowledge about cloud computing—topics that are not covered in depth in university courses.
