### Week 8 Objectives

* Study and understand the main pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework:
  - Secure Architectures (IAM, MFA, SCP, KMS, Security Groups, NACLs, GuardDuty, Shield, WAF, Secrets Manager)
  - Resilient Architectures (Multi-AZ/Region, Auto Scaling, Route 53, Load Balancing, Backup & Restore)
  - High-Performance Architectures (Compute scaling, storage layers, caching, CloudFront)
  - Cost-Optimized Architectures (Cost Explorer, Budgets, Saving Plans, NAT Gateway optimization, Storage Tiering)
* Learn and deploy API Gateway Proxy Resource.
