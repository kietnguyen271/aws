### Week 8 Objectives:
* Learn and understand core AWS Architecture Pillars:
  - Secure Architectures (IAM, MFA, SCP, KMS, Security Groups, NACLs, GuardDuty, Shield, WAF, Secrets Manager)
  - Resilient Architectures (Multi-AZ/Region, Auto Scaling, Route 53, Load Balancing, Backup & Restore)
  - High-Performing Architectures (Compute scaling, Storage options, Caching, CloudFront)
  - Cost-Optimized Architectures (Cost Explorer, Budgets, Saving Plans, NAT Gateway optimization, Storage tiering)
  - Implement and deploy API Gateway Proxy Resource
