During my internship at AWS from September 8th, 2025 to November 28th, 2025, I had the opportunity to experience a real working environment, learn new skills, and apply the knowledge I had previously studied at university. I also participated in the Insight HR project, where I further developed my programming abilities, teamwork skills, and progress reporting.

Throughout the internship, I consistently strived to complete my tasks on time, follow the company's workflows and guidelines, and proactively collaborate with my teammates to improve overall work efficiency.

### Areas for Improvement

During the internship, besides the skills I successfully developed, I also identified several areas where I need to improve in order to perform more effectively in a professional environment:

1. **Ability to learn:**  
   Although I can absorb new knowledge fairly well, I still need to improve my learning speed when dealing with advanced topics such as complex AWS architectures or system-level services. Becoming more proactive in deep research will help strengthen my expertise.

2. **Proactiveness:**  
   At times, I still rely on mentor guidance before starting new tasks. Moving forward, I aim to take more initiative—exploring documentation, proposing potential solutions, and experimenting independently before seeking assistance.

3. **Progressive mindset:**  
   While I am open to feedback, I need to develop a stronger habit of self-evaluation to recognize my weaknesses and set long-term improvement goals, especially in areas such as serverless development, cloud architecture, and DevOps.

4. **Communication:**  
   I recognize the need to enhance my clarity and confidence when presenting ideas or reporting progress in team meetings. Stronger communication will support teamwork and ensure smooth coordination.

5. **Problem-solving skills:**  
   When working with API Gateway, Lambda, or DynamoDB, I sometimes spend significant time identifying root causes of issues. I need to practice structured debugging, improve my log-reading skills, and adopt more systematic troubleshooting methods.

These areas will be my focus for continuous improvement as I work toward becoming a more capable and well-rounded Cloud Engineer.
